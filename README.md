# stopWatch-js
Just a simple stopwatch built with html, css, and javascript


Basic project complete. Counts seconds ascending, adds minutes, pause and reset functions. Going for a clean and friendly look.

When I come back to this I may duplicate it and rework it as a kitchen timer with time set, countdown, and hours added. Maybe even multiple timers?

Until then, cheers!


Bug found: Live testing by some friends found that rapid clicking/tapping on Start resulted in runaway clock speeding up with every click/tap. Need to only allow the button to fire once and disable.
